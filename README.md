# iuri.is()

### 2022 Update

Thanks for your interest in my website! ðŸ™Œ

I'm currently working on a new portfolio to replace this old one, but since many people still visiting it today I decided to refactor it and make this code more re-usable for all of you. So please be patient! 

I'll publish a new version built with React, and another one with Vue.js. 
The main idea will be to allow you guys to re-use all animated components easily on your own projects.

Thank you!

## Current version

This is my [iuri.is](https://iuri.is/) portfolio repo.

It was built using **Vue CLI**, **GSAP**, **NProgress** and **ScrollMagic** (yes, it's old!).

Feel free to copy and reuse anything in this repository.
