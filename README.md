## 2022 "update"

Thanks for your interest in my website! ðŸ™Œ

This project was created back in 2018 and has never being updated since then.

I'm now releasing an "updated" version where I only fixed the failing dependencies and missing configurations to be able to run this project again.

So now you can explore this project if you are looking for inspiration or just curious about how it works.

That said,
I do not recommend you to reuse this code directly on a project nowaways!
There are MANY better ways today to build the same kind of project.

Please check these references for more modern approcahes:

- [GSAP ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/)
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)

## New version

I'm currently working on a new portfolio to replace this old one, but since many people still visiting it today I decided to refactor it and make this code more re-usable for all of you. So please be patient! 

I'll publish a new version built with React, and another one with Vue. 
The main idea will be to allow you guys to re-use all animated components easily on your own projects.
