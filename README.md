ðŸ§š Listen!

Before you start, noticed that this website was built in 2018/2019 and made use of solutions available at the time that are no longer the best way of doing things today! Still, I encourage you to check this solution if you are looking for inspiration, but if you are looking for a "better" way of creating animated websites today, please check these references:

- [GSAP 3](https://greensock.com/3/)
- [GSAP ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/)
- [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)

### New version

I'm currently working on a new portfolio to replace this old one, but since many people's still visiting this one today, I decided to refactor it and make this code more re-usable for all of you. So please be patient! 

I'll publish a new versions built with React Hooks and Vue's composition API. 
The main idea will be to allow you guys to re-use/build animated components easily on your own projects, based on GSAP 3 and ScrollTrigger.
